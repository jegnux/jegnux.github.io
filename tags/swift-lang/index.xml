      <description>The problem While I was reading Twitter, I came across this good question from @Cocoanetics:
Is there a better way to make an enum with associated values equatable? pic.twitter.com/rio4NcRXFc
&amp;mdash; Cocoanetics  (@Cocoanetics) November 21, 2016  Most of responses were pure technical (but still valid) answers. In short:
 you can use a switch to have clearer code, but you still need the same logic
 Maybe. But the logic above feels wrong to me because it tries to make two different cases equatable just because they have the same associated value.</description>
